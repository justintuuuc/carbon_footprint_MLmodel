# Final Project: carbon_footprint_prediction

This project explores the prediction of carbon emissions using machine learning regression models. The focus is on optimizing performance through feature preprocessing, encoding techniques, and hyperparameter tuning.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

- **Objective**: Predict carbon emissions and evaluate the performance of different regression models.
- **Models Used**:
  - Random Forest Regression
  - XGBoost Regression
- **Dataset**: The dataset contains features related to individual activities contributing to carbon emissions.
